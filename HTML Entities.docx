HTML entities: Entities used instead of the actual characters to get the desrired output characters on the display.
They are always initiared with the & symbol and end with a symbol.

1) < and > 
   ->Symbols like <,>; i.e. the lesser than or greater than are special symbols reserved for declaring the tags in HTML. Using them directly may give the unexpected outputs.
   ->To make their use we need the html entities: &gt; and &lt;

2) Other symbols and characters:
    There are my other html entities used.
        &amp; → & (Ampersand) 
        &quot; → " (Double quotation mark)
        &apos; → ' (Single quotation mark)
        &copy; → Copyright
        &trade; → Trademark

3) Instead of short forms, we can also print the characters with their ASCII values.
    Eg &#98; Here we must use the # symbol between & symbol and the ASCII value.

4)Multiple spaces (nbsp)
    HTML, by deafault, doesn't process the multiple spaces.
    To give multiple spaces, instaed of spacing, we use the html enity &nbsp, i.e. non breaking space.

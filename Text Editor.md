Tips:-
1) Start with the boiler plate code saved by default:
    Initially, type "!", then press the TAB or ENTER key. The standard HTML template is made available.

2) Word Wrap:
    In the "View" menu at top, enable the word wrap to keep the entire lines (horizontally) of code visible at the same time. Thus, navigation gets easier
3) Extensions:
    For the best experience, install the extensions:
    i) Live Server: Instead of constantly refreshing the browser page with HTML file, just establish a local host (a server) in your browser. Whenever you save the HTML file (CTRL+S), the output is already updated. (127.0.0.1 in URL signifies the local host.)
    ii) Once saved (CTRL+S), the HTML file is formatted with appropriate identaions and spacings.

4) Using LOREM:
    Making fake text in the dummy websites, as sample use type the Lorem keyword to enter to get the paragraph, LOREM IPSUM.
    Now, complete Lorem para may be big; you may type LOREM followed by number of words to resize. Eg LOREM7.
